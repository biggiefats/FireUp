# Fire Up!
*A game made using the Tkinter GUI Library; part of the Introduction to Programming course from the University of Manchester.*

## Premise
This is a game where you have a cube, Mr Fire.
You have to move Mr Fire around and ensure that you do not get hit by any other enemies.
        
Play this game whilst doing work!
Play this game while revising!
Play this game on the toilet! (Good luck with that one.)

Also there is a secret gamemode. You can try to figure out where it is by navigating the code.
The secret mode introduces its own game mode, with unique enemy generation.
