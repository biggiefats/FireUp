# Fire Up!
*A game made using the Tkinter GUI Library; part of the Introduction to Programming course from the University of Manchester.*

## Premise
This is a game where you have a cube, Mr Fire.
You have to move Mr Fire around and ensure that you do not get hit by any other enemies.
        
Play this game whilst doing work!

The secret mode introduces its own game mode, with unique enemy generation.
